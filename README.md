# openSA

An open-source reimplementation of the **GTA San Andreas** runtime, written in C++ on top of
[librw](https://github.com/aap/librw) and checked against the 1.0 US executable you already own.

> **No game files are included and none are needed in this repository.** You need your own copy of
> GTA San Andreas (the viewers only read its `data/` and `models/` folders). This project is not affiliated
> with Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive.

## Status

Early stage. This is a data and streaming layer plus viewers, not a playable game.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| IMG v2, `gta.dat`/`default.dat`, all IDE sections, text + binary IPL, DFF/TXD loading | done; the whole stock game parses without errors |
| Streaming slot layout (`CStreaming::LoadCdDirectory`), pool sizes (`CPools::Initialise`), TXD slots | done, taken from the decompiled executable |
| Streamer (request / load / remove, model → TXD → parent TXD chain) | done (synchronous, no loading channels or memory budget yet) |
| `sa_stream`: whole-map viewer that streams models and textures around a free camera, with LOD | done; distance/LOD rule follows `SetupMapEntityVisibility` (colModel radius from COL headers; no occlusion, tunnels or fade yet) |
| Vehicles: palette paint, wheels | partial: stock wheel per car and right-wheel orientation unverified |
| Real `CRenderer` visibility/LOD rules | distance part done; culling pending; big-building rule from `CFileLoader`; LOD multiplier follows `CCamera::Process` (FOV assumed 70) |
| Time of day: `timecyc.dat` parsed, sky colour, fog, far clip and ambient follow `SA_HOUR` / `SA_WEATHER` (no sky dome, no per-vertex day/night lighting, no weather changes) | partial |
| Vehicle reflections, collision physics, peds, traffic, scripts, audio | not started |

The goal is behaviour identical to the original game. Facts read from the executable are marked as such in
the source comments (function names and addresses refer to the 1.0 US executable); everything else is an
assumption and is called out as one.

## Build (Windows, Visual Studio 2022, CMake 3.15+)

```bat
git clone https://github.com/LakoMoor/openSA
cd openSA
git clone https://github.com/aap/librw third_party/librw

cmake -S sa_view -B build/view
cmake --build build/view --config Release --target sa_stream sa_world sa_view

build\view\Release\sa_stream.exe "C:\Games\GTA San Andreas" 2495 -1690
```

Controls: `W A S D` move, `Q`/`E` down/up, `Shift` faster, left mouse drag to look, `Esc` quits.
`sa_world.exe <gamedir> [x y radius]` shows a static slice of the map, `sa_view.exe <gamedir> [model]` shows one
model (try `infernus`, `cheetah`, `banshee`).

Data-layer tools (no GPU needed):

```bat
cmake -S sa_port -B build/port
cmake --build build/port --config Release
build\port\Release\load_all.exe "C:\Games\GTA San Andreas"   :: parse every IDE/IPL, report problems
build\port\Release\stream_info.exe "C:\Games\GTA San Andreas" :: slot assignment + streamer self-test
```

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `sa_port/src` | data library: archives, IDE/IPL, RenderWare chunk walker, streaming slots, streamer |
| `sa_view` | librw (D3D9) viewers: `sa_view`, `sa_world`, `sa_stream` |
| `tools` | helpers for mapping function addresses to names from the public gta-reversed project |
| `branding` | logo and icon (original artwork) and the script that draws them |
| `docs` | project website (GitHub Pages) |
